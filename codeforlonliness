      <h2>
        What Is Loneliness and Why Is It Rising in a Technology-Driven Society?
      </h2>
      <div class="two-col">
        <div>
          <p>
            Loneliness has become one of the biggest problems our generation
            and future generations face, even though nobody truly wants to
            admit it. According to the U.S. Surgeon General, over “60% of young
            adults feel lonely regularly,” despite the fact we live in an era
            that is defined by technology and constant connection (U.S. Surgeon
            General). This raises the important question: Why is loneliness
            rising in a time where people are connected more than ever? What is
            causing this shift, and what can we do to combat this issue? Even
            though technology gives us unlimited access to social media, our
            genuine relationships have lost depth and meaning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Loneliness isn’t just being alone. Psychology Today defines it as
            “the feeling that your actual level of connection does not match the
            level of connection you want” (Psychology Today). That means you can
            be in a group chat, have hundreds of followers, and still feel
            deeply disconnected. Today, heavy social media use replaces
            face-to-face conversations, and community spaces like parks, clubs,
            and hangouts are disappearing. People feel pressure to appear happy,
            successful, and put-together online, which turns their lives into a
            performance instead of honest connection. Technology has increased
            the number of people we talk to, but not the <strong>depth</strong>
            of those relationships.

      <h2>How Are Digital Connections Making People More Isolated?</h2>
      <div class="two-col">
        <div>
          <p>
            The new digital communication plays a crucial role in why people
            feel so isolated in such a connected world. Sherry Turkle, an
            American sociologist, explains that “people can have hundreds of
            online friends and still feel alone” because online interaction is
            not a strong, in-depth interaction (Turkle,
            <em>Reclaiming Conversation</em>). In her TED Talk, Turkle says that
            we have all become “alone together,” where everyone is physically
            present but mentally in a different world on their phone (Turkle,
            “Connected, but Alone?”).
          </p>
          <p>
            Social media leads to comparison and competition: Who is traveling
            more? Who looks better? Whose life seems perfect? The more people
            swipe their finger up, the more they feel like they aren’t good
            enough. Algorithms on social media are designed to keep us trapped
            online, not to make us feel content with life. This leads to
            anxiety, depression, poor self-esteem, and emotional disconnection,
            leaving people feeling even more isolated even when their phone is
            blowing up with notifications (Twenge and Campbell).

      <h2>What Other Factors Contribute to the Loneliness Epidemic?</h2>
      <div class="two-col">
        <div>
          <p>
            In addition to the development of technology and social media, there
            are also societal factors behind rising loneliness in the world.
            Killgore’s psychiatry research shows that loneliness “rose sharply
            during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and stayed high afterward”
            (Killgore et al.). During the pandemic, interactions changed as we
            knew it—schools turned to Zoom, work went remote, and everyone’s
            social life moved online. Pew Research found that loneliness among
            Gen Z increased by a whopping 40% after 2020. The face-to-face human
            interactions that made people feel grounded—classroom conversations,
            walking with friends, going out for lunch, and even talking to
            coworkers—were stripped away.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, post-pandemic, cities and towns promote more independent
            lifestyles, with fewer shared spaces and fast-paced environments
            that leave little to no room for building meaningful relationships.
            Emotional burnout from constant notifications and digital
            overstimulation also makes it harder to connect in meaningful ways.
            Many people fear rejection, so they avoid vulnerability, which
            increases loneliness. As a result, people are less present, less
            self-aware, and less likely to prioritize real connections.

    <section id="solutions" class="highlight">
      <span class="pill">Solutions</span>
      <h2>
        How Can Individuals, Communities, and Tech Companies Help Heal
        Loneliness?
      </h2>

      <h3>A. What Can Individuals Do?</h3>
      <p>
        Surgeon General Vivek Murthy has stated, “To heal loneliness, we must
        replace screen time with shared time” (Murthy, 2022). This means putting
        the phone down and going out of your way to spend face-to-face time with
        people, volunteering, or being open in conversations. One of the
        strongest ways to build authentic connection is through being
        vulnerable.
      </p>

      <h3>B. What Can Communities Do?</h3>
      <p>
        Murthy also says, “Community is the medicine for isolation” (Murthy,
        2023). If communities create inclusive events, are transparent in mental
        health conversations, and set up spaces that encourage interaction,
        fewer people will feel isolated. Schools, workplaces, and neighborhoods
        can all play a role in rebuilding that sense of belonging.
      </p>

      <h3>C. What Can Technology Companies Do?</h3>
      <p>
        Big technology companies also share responsibility in combating
        loneliness—not just users and their communities. Twenge and Campbell
        argue that “designing digital environments that foster well-being
        instead of addiction could reduce loneliness globally” (Twenge and
        Campbell). Apps like TikTok, Instagram, and X (formerly Twitter) could
        include screen-time reminders, promote conversations about mental
        health, and create features that encourage meaningful conversations
        instead of just likes and views.

    <!-- SECTION 5: Personal Connection -->
    <section id="personal" class="personal">
      <span class="pill">Personal Connection</span>
      <h2>Why Does This Question Matter to Me Personally?</h2>
      <p>
        For me, this issue matters because I am one of the millions who have
        felt the effects of loneliness due to social media, even though I am
        surrounded by dozens of people. There were times I was active on social
        media, messaging people, staying “connected,” yet I still felt lonely
        because I was disconnected in real life. The more time I spent online,
        the more I compared myself to my peers who seemed to have perfect lives
        or met personal goals. Instead of helping, technology and social media
        made me feel like I wasn’t doing enough—like I was falling short.
      </p>
      <p>
        After doing research on this topic though, I understand what the Surgeon
        General meant about screen time replacing shared time (U.S. Surgeon
        General). Whenever I spent face-to-face time with family, worked out
        with friends, or even had a short conversation with someone at work, the
        loneliness faded a bit. This is why this topic is meaningful to me. I
        have seen firsthand how easy it is to feel isolated even if you’re not
        “alone,” and I know that real connection feels different and more
        rewarding than anything technology and social media can provide.
      </p>

    <!-- SECTION 6: Future -->
    <section id="future">
      <span class="pill">Looking Ahead</span>
      <h2>Why Does the Future of Human Connection Still Look Hopeful?</h2>
      <p>
        Despite how serious the loneliness epidemic is, the future is very
        promising for future generations. The <em>Harvard Gazette</em> said,
        “The loneliness epidemic has sparked a global awakening about what real
        connection means” (Harvard Gazette). As loneliness is acknowledged more
        openly, schools, governments, and workplaces are beginning to create
        programs that combat loneliness by fostering community and mental health
        initiatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many people are realizing that nonstop busyness and constant interaction
        on social media aren’t enough to meet our basic human need for real
        connection. Right now, there is a cultural shift occurring toward
        empathy, presence, and genuine community. If individuals, local
        communities, and major technology companies work together to address the
        loneliness epidemic, we can rebuild meaningful, authentic connections.
